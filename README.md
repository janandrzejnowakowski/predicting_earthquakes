# Capstone project - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## 1. Test/train data

In order for this notebook to run, the training and the testing data needs to be downloaded from this source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction/data

The 'data' folder needs to be in the same folder as this notebook. In the data folder, there should be a 'train.csv' file that contains all of the training data, 'sample_submission.csv' file that contains names of the segments of the training data, as well as a 'test' folder, that contains all of the test data segments.


## 2. Requirements

### 2 out of 4 models implemented in this project require a GPU to run 
### therefore it requires cuDNN and CUDA (tested on CUDA 9.0)

required python libraries: 

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas 
- keras
- tensorflow-gp
